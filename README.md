# SoLMISS

The Somewhat Less Mediocre Item Storage System.

SoLMISS's primary advantages over MISS are:

 - a significantly nicer configuration system, with first-time setup UIs and whatnot
 - support for multiple terminals on the same network, managed by one server computer

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0Bhe3_xYps) for a quick setup tutorial.
