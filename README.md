# SLMISS

The Slightly Less Mediocre Item Storage System.

Setup is a little more complex than MISS 1.  You need one "server" computer and at least one "client" computer, and several chests, all on the same network.  On the "server" computer you should run `server.lua`, and on the clients run `client.lua`.  The server's menu includes administrative and debugging options, while the clients' menus are nearly the same as the original MISS.
